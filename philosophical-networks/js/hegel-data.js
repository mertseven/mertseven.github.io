    // Core Hegelian Concepts
    {
      id: "geist",
      name: "Geist (Spirit)",
      category: "concept",
      description: "The central concept in Hegel's philosophy, sometimes translated as 'Mind' or 'Spirit'. Represents the collective consciousness that develops through history. Geist is like 'team spirit' - the 'I' that is a 'we' and the 'we' that is an 'I'. It embodies the relationship between individual consciousness and the larger whole of human experience."
    },
    {
      id: "dialectic",
      name: "Dialectic",
      category: "concept",
      description: "The process through which history and thought progress through contradictions. In Hegel's view, a thesis encounters its antithesis, creating a contradiction that is resolved in a synthesis (though Hegel didn't use these exact terms). This movement drives all historical development."
    },
    {
      id: "aufheben",
      name: "Aufheben",
      category: "concept",
      description: "A key term in Hegelian philosophy that means simultaneously to negate, preserve, and elevate. When a dialectical progression moves forward, the previous state is 'aufgehoben' - canceled yet preserved as it's taken to a higher level, like a bud being replaced by a blossom."
    },
    {
      id: "phenomenology",
      name: "Phenomenology (Hegel)", // Clarified for Hegel's specific use
      category: "concept",
      description: "Hegel's approach to understanding consciousness through examining how it appears or manifests itself. The study of phenomena as they appear to consciousness and how consciousness itself develops through various stages."
    },
    {
      id: "absolute_knowledge",
      name: "Absolute Knowledge",
      category: "concept",
      description: "The culmination of Geist's journey in Hegel's Phenomenology, representing complete self-knowledge. The point at which Spirit understands itself fully and overcomes all alienation, recognizing itself in everything."
    },
    {
      id: "becoming",
      name: "Becoming (Werden)",
      category: "concept",
      description: "Contrasted with 'Being' (Sein), becoming represents Hegel's focus on process and development rather than static existence. For Hegel, everything is always in motion, always becoming rather than simply being."
    },
    {
      id: "alienation",
      name: "Alienation (Hegel)", // Clarified
      category: "concept",
      description: "The condition in which consciousness sees the world as separate from itself, creating a subject-object divide. The history of Spirit in Hegel is an attempt to overcome this alienation and recognize itself in everything."
    },
    {
      id: "quantity_quality",
      name: "Quantity into Quality",
      category: "concept",
      description: "Hegel's idea that quantitative changes, when reaching a certain threshold, produce qualitative change. Like water heating gradually until it suddenly boils, small incremental changes can lead to fundamental transformations."
    },
    {
      id: "self_consciousness",
      name: "Self-Consciousness",
      category: "concept",
      description: "The stage of consciousness that reflects upon itself, crucial for the development of Geist. It emerges through the recognition of other consciousnesses in a dynamic of mutual recognition."
    },
    {
      id: "master_slave",
      name: "Master-Slave Dialectic",
      category: "concept",
      description: "Hegel's famous analysis of how self-consciousness develops through the struggle between two consciousnesses, resulting in a master-slave relationship that ultimately proves unsatisfactory for both parties and must be overcome."
    },
    {
      id: "world_spirit",
      name: "World Spirit",
      category: "concept",
      description: "Hegel's conception of history as the manifestation of Geist working itself out. When he saw Napoleon on horseback, he reportedly called him 'world spirit on horseback,' seeing in Napoleon the embodiment of historical forces."
    },
    {
      id: "history",
      name: "Philosophy of History",
      category: "concept",
      description: "Hegel's view that history has a rational structure and direction, moving toward greater freedom and self-consciousness. History is not random but follows a logical pattern as Geist develops."
    },
    {
      id: "owl_minerva",
      name: "Owl of Minerva",
      category: "concept",
      description: "Hegel's metaphor that 'the owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk,' meaning that philosophical understanding only comes after events have transpired, not before. We can only understand history looking backward."
    },
    
    // Shared concepts with Enlightenment/Romanticism
    {
      id: "reason",
      name: "Reason (Hegel)", // Clarified
      category: "shared_concept",
      description: "For Hegel, reason is not just subjective human thinking but objective reality itself. He sought to overcome the Enlightenment divide between reason and reality by showing that the rational is real and the real is rational."
    },
    {
      id: "freedom",
      name: "Freedom (Hegel)", // Clarified
      category: "shared_concept",
      description: "Unlike Kantian freedom based on individual moral intention, Hegelian freedom is 'the recognition of necessity.' True freedom comes through understanding the rational necessities that drive history and aligning oneself with them."
    },
    {
      id: "consciousness",
      name: "Consciousness (Hegel)", // Clarified
      category: "shared_concept",
      description: "The starting point of Hegel's Phenomenology, which develops through various stages toward Absolute Knowledge. Unlike Enlightenment thinkers, Hegel sees consciousness as historically situated and developing, not static."
    },
    {
      id: "subject_object",
      name: "Subject-Object Divide",
      category: "shared_concept",
      description: "The problem of how consciousness (subject) relates to the external world (object). Hegel attempts to overcome this 'problem of the bridge' by showing how subject and object are ultimately manifestations of the same Geist."
    },
    {
      id: "nature",
      name: "Nature (Hegel)", // Clarified
      category: "shared_concept",
      description: "For Hegel, nature is not merely mechanical as in Enlightenment thought, nor purely spiritual as in Romanticism. Instead, it's an externalization of Geist that Spirit must recognize itself in and overcome its alienation from."

      id: "napoleon",
      name: "Napoleon Bonaparte",
      category: "event", // Categorizing Napoleon as an 'event' or 'influence' makes more sense in this context than shared_concept. Let's use 'event' to tie him to historical occurrences.
      years: "1769-1821", // Added years
      description: "Napoleon was seen by Hegel as the embodiment of World Spirit on horseback, representing the historical forces of the French Revolution transformed into imperial power. Hegel reportedly saw Napoleon in Jena before completing his Phenomenology."
