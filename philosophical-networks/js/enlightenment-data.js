        // Core concepts
        { id: "reason", name: "Reason", category: "concept", description: "The central concept of the Enlightenment, exalted above tradition and religious authority. Seen as the defining human characteristic that allows understanding of the world. Kant defined Enlightenment as humankind's release from self-incurred immaturity through the use of reason. The Enlightenment saw reason as the primary means of understanding the world and improving human life, replacing religious dogma and traditional authority." },
        { id: "empiricism", name: "Empiricism", category: "concept", description: "Knowledge gained through sensory experience and observation rather than pure theory. Newton's approach to understanding physical laws through observation exemplifies this. Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) established empiricism as a major force in Enlightenment thought, arguing that all ideas come from experience. This approach influenced the development of modern science and challenged traditional metaphysical systems." },
        { id: "social_contract", name: "Social Contract", category: "concept", description: "Theory that people's moral and political obligations are dependent upon an agreement to form society. Different versions proposed by Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. Hobbes saw it as a means to escape the state of nature's chaos, Locke as a way to protect natural rights, and Rousseau as a way to achieve collective freedom through the general will. This concept fundamentally changed how people thought about political authority and legitimacy." },
        { id: "state_of_nature", name: "State of Nature", category: "concept", description: "Hypothetical condition of humanity before social contracts and civilization. Viewed as war (Hobbes), freedom (Locke), or virtue (Rousseau). This concept was central to Enlightenment political thought, serving as a thought experiment to understand human nature and justify different forms of government. It helped thinkers imagine how society might be organized on rational principles rather than traditional authority." },
        { id: "epistemology", name: "Epistemology", category: "concept", description: "The study of knowledge - how we know what we know. Central preoccupation of modern philosophy beginning with Descartes. The Enlightenment saw a fundamental shift in how knowledge was understood, moving from reliance on authority and tradition to emphasis on reason and experience. This led to new questions about the limits of human knowledge and the relationship between mind and world." },
        { id: "deism", name: "Deism", category: "concept", description: "Belief that God created the world but then stepped aside, endowing humans with reason. A middle ground between Christianity and atheism promoted by Voltaire. Deists believed in a rational, natural religion based on reason rather than revelation. This belief system was particularly influential in the American Enlightenment and helped promote religious tolerance and separation of church and state." },
        { id: "disenchantment", name: "Disenchantment", category: "concept", description: "Weber's term for the Enlightenment's removal of magic, miracles, and supernatural forces from understanding the world. This process involved the systematic application of reason and scientific method to explain phenomena that were previously attributed to supernatural causes. It led to a more secular, rational understanding of the world." },
        { id: "rationality", name: "Rationality", category: "concept", description: "The quality of being based on reason rather than emotions or feelings. Central to Enlightenment thinking. The Enlightenment saw rationality as the key to human progress and the means to overcome superstition and prejudice. This emphasis on rationality influenced everything from scientific method to political theory to moral philosophy." },
        { id: "positivism", name: "Positivism", category: "concept", description: "Understanding the world based on empirical observation without supernatural explanations. This approach, exemplified by Newton's scientific method, sought to explain phenomena through natural laws rather than divine intervention. It became a model for understanding both the physical and social world." },
        { id: "cogito", name: "Cogito, ergo sum", category: "concept", description: "Descartes' famous conclusion: 'I think, therefore I am.' The foundation of modern philosophy and the only certainty after radical doubt. This principle established the primacy of individual consciousness and reason as the starting point for philosophical inquiry. It marked a shift from medieval philosophy's reliance on authority to modern philosophy's emphasis on individual reason." },
        { id: "consent", name: "Consent of the Governed", category: "concept", description: "Locke's idea that legitimate government authority comes from the consent of those governed, not divine right. This concept challenged traditional notions of political authority based on divine right or hereditary privilege. It became a fundamental principle of modern democratic theory and influenced the American and French revolutions." },
        { id: "general_will", name: "General Will", category: "concept", description: "Rousseau's concept of the collective will that is not simply the sum of individual wills but represents the common good. This idea influenced both democratic theory and totalitarian thought. It raised important questions about the relationship between individual freedom and collective decision-making." },
        { id: "tolerance", name: "Religious Tolerance", category: "concept", description: "Advocacy for freedom of religious belief and practice. Championed by Voltaire in his Treatise on Toleration. This concept emerged from the religious wars of the early modern period and became a central Enlightenment value. It influenced the development of modern secular states and the separation of church and state." },
        { id: "liberty", name: "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity", category: "concept", description: "Slogan of the French Revolution embodying Enlightenment ideals of freedom, equal rights, and brotherhood. These principles represented the Enlightenment's vision of a just society based on reason rather than tradition. They continue to influence modern political thought and democratic movements." },
        { id: "sapere_aude", name: "Sapere Aude", category: "concept", description: "Kant's motto for the Enlightenment: 'Dare to know' or 'Have courage to use your own reason.' This phrase captured the Enlightenment's spirit of intellectual independence and the rejection of authority. It encouraged individuals to think for themselves rather than relying on tradition or authority." },
        { id: "copernican_revolution", name: "Copernican Revolution", category: "concept", description: "Kant's philosophical revolution: it's not our minds that conform to the world, but the world as we experience it conforms to our minds. This idea fundamentally changed how philosophers understood the relationship between human knowledge and reality. It influenced the development of modern epistemology and philosophy of science." },

He sought to establish a secure foundation for knowledge based on clear and distinct ideas." },
        { id: "hobbes", name: "Thomas Hobbes", years: "1588-1679", category: "philosopher", description: "Viewed the state of nature as a state of war with life being 'nasty, brutish, and short.'

Opposed religious oppression while believing in God as creator. His wit and criticism of traditional authority made him one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers. He championed freedom of thought and expression." },
        { id: "rousseau", name: "Jean-Jacques Rousseau", years: "1712-1778", category: "philosopher", description: "Believed the state of nature was a state of virtue corrupted by property and society.

        { id: "kant", name: "Immanuel Kant", years: "1724-1804", category: "philosopher", description: "Defined Enlightenment as 'man's exit from immaturity' with the motto 'Sapere aude' (Dare to know).
